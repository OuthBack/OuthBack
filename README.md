## 📖 About Me
  #### 👏 Hi, I'm Henrique, also knowed as OuthBack.
I’m a software engineer with a passion for impacting lives through innovative solutions, through making companies increase their
profits or making them efficient. I try to solve problems using the proper technology instead using what prefer for comfort.

I have three years of experience and worked for two companies: a start‑up and a big enterprise . I have worked in the following
industries; banking, big data, e-commerce. 

I have contributed to open source projects like trpc. Also, I have published a NPM package.
